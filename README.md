# AI_Model_Kinematic_Reconstruction
Development of an Artificial Intelligence model for the kinematic reconstruction of the hand using EEG and EMG signals

development of a system that implements artificial intelligence to provide solutionsto the problem of estimating the kinematics of a member by through biological signals such as EEG and EMG signals non-invasive using deep learning techniques.
