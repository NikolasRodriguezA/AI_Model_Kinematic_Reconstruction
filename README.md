# AI_Model_Kinematic_Reconstruction
Development of an Artificial Intelligence model for the kinematic reconstruction of the hand using EEG and EMG signals

development of a system that implements artificial intelligence to provide solutionsto the problem of estimating the kinematics of a member by through biological signals such as EEG and EMG signals non-invasive using deep learning techniques.

 The project structure is divided into the acquisition stage that contains the developments to carry out the acquisition (EEG, EMG and gloves).

The Data directory contains the data obtained from the acquisition.

The EDA directory contains exploratory analysis and data treatment developments after model development.

The Model directory contains the development of the model and its validations
